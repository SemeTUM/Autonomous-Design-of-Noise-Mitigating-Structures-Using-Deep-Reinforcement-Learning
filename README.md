#Autonomous Design of Noise Mitigating Structures Using Deep Reinforcement Learning

The configuration of two materials that result in optimal absorption is usually addressed using optimization algorithms. 
In recent years, data-driven approaches that rely on labeled data are used to design acoustic metamaterials and generate new shapes within the proximity of the trained data. 
Deep reinforcement learning algorithms have shown impressive performance, outperforming human performance and conventional methodologies in playing games and in robotics. 
This paper deals with the autonomous learning and configuration of two materials in a given space using deep reinforcement learning algorithms. 
We consider a reflection and transmission problem; where the reflection problem deals with a combination of porous and solid materials in a two-microphone setup, whereas the latter deals with the combination of air and solid materials in a transmission tube setup. 
Utilizing deep Q-network and double deep Q-network, we show that the agent autonomously captures the intrinsic relation between the configurations and their absorption (transmission loss) performance using convolutional neural networks.
